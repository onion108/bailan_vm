# Bailan VM

## Overview
Bailan VM is a simple VM implemented in C++. It just one of my little practices.

## Build & Install
To build it, you just need to:
```shell
cmake .
make
```
And you will see an executable file called `vm_test` (or `vm_test.exe`, maybe) in the project directory.  

## As a Library
But, to be honest, it's goal is not to just solve A+B Problem and print `Hello, world!` 6 times. Actually, if you like it, you can use it as a library. Just copy `vm.cc` and `vm.hh` to your project directory and enjoy it!
