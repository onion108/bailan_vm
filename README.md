# Bailan VM

## Overview
Bailan VM is a simple VM implemented in C++. It just one of my little practices, but my friend, *Zihao Qu* encouraged me to open its source.

## Build & Install
To build it, you just need to:
```shell
cmake .
make
```
And you will see an executable file called `vm_test` (or `vm_test.exe`, maybe) in the project directory.  

## Special Things
Oh, I don't like you, C++!  
Let's use Rust.
